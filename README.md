      What started as a small bot aimed for no more than just printing
      out the latest episode info in chat turned in to something much,
      much more.  At the time of this writing, it supports:

              - CleverBot integration
              - A creepy stalker subrouting (I'm a horror fan)
              - A memos system to relay a message to another user
              - Unobtrusive and entertaining idle chat.
              - Twitter Integration, including:
                      - Being able to send tweets as the bot.
                      - The bot auto-follows its followers.
                      - The bot randomly reads a follower's latest tweet in chat.
                      - You can get any twitter user's latest tweet in chat.
                      - The bot responds to tweets @ it on Twitter
                      - The bot automatically displays tweets @ it in chat too.
              - Channel op commands, if user's in the admin file:
                      - Op a user
                      - Change the topic
